I would like a refund of my $88. No where on your site do you say you need a boarding pass to go to Level 6/7 at Shanghai Terminal 1. I couldn't get to level 6 because I didn't have a boarding pass. I arrived from Shanghai at 9:45. I went directly to the United counter to check-in and get a boarding pass. The United counter was closed and wasn't going to open again till 8 a.m. the next morning. Without a boarding pass they wouldn't let me go up to Lounge Buddy. I had a reservation for 12 hours which I paid $88. I slept in the airport lobby and after I received my boarding pass at 8:15 a.m. I went to LoungeBuddy and talked toMun Gurung at the desk and she said I should ask for a refund as I would only be able to use the lounge for 30 minutes. Please refund my money. I really think the LoungeBuddy is a good service when you can access it. Please put in your website that you need to have a boarding pass to access yourself to that level.

Entry was permitted but then we were approached by reception in the lounge to forward our receipt by email 10 minutes later which was a bit annoying. So if you could ensure barcodes are shown on wallet document and perhaps train lounge receptionists on loungebuddy procedures to negate double handling and embarrassment. ,1,Kiooxh5rj9,CONSUMER_LOUNGEBUDDY,sharonmcweeney@gmail.com,Sharon,Smullen McWeeney,2,AUD,106,false,2017-04-15 16:52:50,2017-04-15 17:01:20,c44df5e7bf

So based on the instruction on the booking detail, I tried to find the correct lounge. After one hour finding the place, we arrived in the lounge and the guy that guarding the entrance look at us with pity and said that we made mistake and our lounge is not there(which refer to much lower class). So we went to find the place, after around 2 hours walking and taking terminal train we found the place. Fyi I was traveling with my elderly Mother, and the lounge was on the second floor (no lift) and we bringing several luggage. So we finally arrived on the correct lounge, the guy was rejecting us and keep telling us the voucher from LoungeBuddy is not worth it. So disappointing. We have to bring our luggage and I have to hold my Mother to go to first floor (although the guy know that they have working lift behind him, and he was not allowing us to use it. I guess, we still a bit lucking, there was a lady show how difficult my Mom going down, and she mentioned that I can use the lift. We come back after half way down and almost used the lift. And she asked what's going on, I told her that we have voucher from LoungeBuddy, and finally she checked on her computer. She finally let us in. Ridiculous!!! We cannot even take shower there, because no one open the bathroom door.
